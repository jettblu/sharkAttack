# Shark Attack

This repository is for a data analysis course at Carnegie Mellon.

Our goal is to research the following questions:
1. What is the relationship between company location and valuation?
2. How well can we predict deal flow from a subset of predictors? (Logistic regression)
3. How does each “shark” relate to the companies they invest in terms of categories?
4. Is there a relationship between episode number (show progression) and the valuation of companies?
